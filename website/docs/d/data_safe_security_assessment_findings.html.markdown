# Data Source: oci_data_safe_security_assessment_findings
This data source provides the list of Security Assessment Findings in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Safe service.

List all the findings from all the targets in the specified assessment.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_data_safe_security_assessment_findings" "test_security_assessment_findings" {
	#Required
	security_assessment_id = oci_data_safe_security_assessment.test_security_assessment.id

	#Optional
	access_level = var.security_assessment_finding_access_level
	compartment_id_in_subtree = var.security_assessment_finding_compartment_id_in_subtree
	finding_key = var.security_assessment_finding_finding_key
	severity = var.security_assessment_finding_severity
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `access_level` - (Optional) Valid values are RESTRICTED and ACCESSIBLE. Default is RESTRICTED. Setting this to ACCESSIBLE returns only those compartments for which the user has INSPECT permissions directly or indirectly (permissions can be on a resource in a subcompartment). When set to RESTRICTED permissions are checked and no partial results are displayed. 
* `compartment_id_in_subtree` - (Optional) Default is false. When set to true, the hierarchy of compartments is traversed and all compartments and subcompartments in the tenancy are returned. Depends on the 'accessLevel' setting. 
* `finding_key` - (Optional) Each finding has a key. This key is same for the finding across targets
* `security_assessment_id` - (Required) The OCID of the security assessment.
* `severity` - (Optional) A filter to return only findings of a particular risk level.
