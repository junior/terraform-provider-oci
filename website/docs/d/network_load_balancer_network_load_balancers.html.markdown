# Data Source: oci_network_load_balancer_network_load_balancers
This data source provides the list of Network Load Balancers in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Network Load Balancer service.

Returns a list of network load balancers.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_network_load_balancer_network_load_balancers" "test_network_load_balancers" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	display_name = var.network_load_balancer_display_name
	state = var.network_load_balancer_state
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment containing the network load balancers to list. 
* `display_name` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the entire display name given.
* `state` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the given lifecycle state.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `network_load_balancer_collection` - The list of network_load_balancer_collection.

### NetworkLoadBalancer Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `compartment_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment containing the network load balancer.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `display_name` - A user-friendly name, which does not have to be unique, and can be changed.  Example: `example_load_balancer` 
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the network load balancer.
* `ip_addresses` - An array of IP addresses. 
    * `ip_address` - An IP address.  Example: `192.168.0.3`
    * `ip_version` - IP version associated with this IP address.
    * `is_public` - Whether the IP address is public or private.
        If "true", then the IP address is public and accessible from the internet.

        If "false", then the IP address is private and accessible only from within the associated virtual cloud network. 
      * `reserved_ip` - An object representing a reserved IP address to be attached or that is already attached to a network load balancer. 
          * `id` - OCID of the reserved public IP address created with the virtual cloud network.

              Reserved public IP addresses are IP addresses that are registered using the virtual cloud network API.

              Create a reserved public IP address. When you create the network load balancer, enter the OCID of the reserved public IP address in the reservedIp field to attach the IP address to the network load balancer. This task configures the network load balancer to listen to traffic on this IP address.

              Reserved public IP addresses are not deleted when the network load balancer is deleted. The IP addresses become unattached from the network load balancer.

              Example: "ocid1.publicip.oc1.phx.unique_ID" 
* `is_preserve_source_destination` - When enabled, the skipSourceDestinationCheck parameter is automatically enabled on the load balancer VNIC. Packets are sent to the backend set without any changes to the source and destination IP. 
* `is_private` - Whether the network load balancer has a virtual cloud network-local (private) IP address.

    If "true", then the service assigns a private IP address to the network load balancer.

    If "false", then the service assigns a public IP address to the network load balancer.

    A public network load balancer is accessible from the internet, depending the [security list rules](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/network/Concepts/securitylists.htm) for your virtual cloudn network. For more information about public and private network load balancers, see [How Network Load Balancing Works](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Balance/Concepts/balanceoverview.htm#how-network-load-balancing-works). This value is true by default.

    Example: `true` 
* `lifecycle_details` - A message describing the current state in more detail. For example, can be used to provide actionable information for a resource in Failed state. 
* `network_security_group_ids` - An array of network security groups [OCIDs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) associated with the network load balancer.

    During the creation of the network load balancer, the service adds the new load balancer to the specified network security groups.

    The benefits of associating the network load balancer with network security groups include:
    *  Network security groups define network security rules to govern ingress and egress traffic for the network load balancer.
    *  The network security rules of other resources can reference the network security groups associated with the network load balancer to ensure access.

    Example: ["ocid1.nsg.oc1.phx.unique_ID"] 
* `state` - The current state of the network load balancer.
* `subnet_id` - The subnet in which the network load balancer is spawned [OCIDs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm)."
* `nlb_ip_version` - IP version associated with the NLB.
* `system_tags` - Key-value pair representing system tags' keys and values scoped to a namespace. Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}` 
* `time_created` - The date and time the network load balancer was created, in the format defined by RFC3339.  Example: `2020-05-01T21:10:29.600Z` 
* `time_updated` - The time the network load balancer was updated. An RFC3339 formatted date-time string.  Example: `2020-05-01T22:10:29.600Z`
