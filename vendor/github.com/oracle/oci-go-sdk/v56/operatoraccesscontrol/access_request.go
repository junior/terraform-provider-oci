// AccessRequest An Oracle operator raises access request when they need access to any infrastructure resource governed by Operator Access Control.
// The access request identifies the target resource and the set of operator actions. Access request handling depends upon the Operator Control
// that governs the target resource, and the set of operator actions listed for approval in the access request. If all of the operator actions
// listed in the access request are in the pre-approved list in the Operator Control that governs the target resource, then the access request is
// automatically approved. If not, then the access request requires explicit approval from the approver group specified by the Operator Control governing the target resource.
// You can approve or reject an access request. You can also revoke the approval of an already approved access request. While creating an access request,
// the operator specifies the duration of access. You have the option to approve the entire duration or reduce or even increase the time duration.
// An operator can also request for an extension. The approval for such an extension is processed the same way the original access request was processed.
